Why am I programming?
This question allows me to build my sense of life, strength and motivation for it.
When I was a little kid my dream was to become programmers, but life unfortunately got very complicated. However, I never stopped believing that I would succeed, I have been learning to program for a year, I love the ability to create images with code. Build a beautiful mechanism. It is something that gives me the strength to fight and develop!
